# IMAGE Conductance Builder

`icBuilder` is a tool for processing IMAGE WIC, SI12, and SI13 data to estimate ionospheric conductance with propagated uncertainties.

Estimated conductances with associated uncertainties are available [**here**](#).

> ⚠️ `icBuilder` is **not intended** for reading the estimated conductances.  
> For that purpose, use the lightweight companion tool [`icReader`](#).

## Project Description

This code was developed to robustly estimate ionospheric conductances from IMAGE data. All IMAGE data between 2000 and 2001 has been processed and is available [**here**](#) (link to dataset or repository).

The main purpose of this codebase is to document the data processing procedure. While not primarily designed for external use, the code can be run by others if needed.

## Dependencies

- [`fuvpy`](https://github.com/aohma/fuvpy) – for FUV image processing **[3]**
- [`secsy`](https://github.com/klaundal/secsy) - for cubed sphere grid generation
- [`tqdm`](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) – for progress bars (optional; can be removed with minor edits)
- [`icReader`](https://github.com/BingMM/icReader) - for reading conductance output files (optional; used for creating conductance figures)

## Installation

mamba activate your_environment

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/icBuilder.git

cd icBuilder

pip install -e .

## Step-by-Step Guide

The code is designed to be run in the following sequence:

### `make_orbit_h5_files.py`

- Scans available WIC, SI12, and SI13 data.
- Assigns each file to an orbit based on `orbitsdates.csv`.

### `make_orbit_nc_files.py`

- Reads WIC, SI12, and SI13 data.
- Applies a background removal algorithm.
- Saves the results into a series of NetCDF files **[3]**.

### `make_background_removal_figures.py` *(optional)*

- Plots the data stored in the NetCDF files for quality inspection.

### `grid_resolution_determination.py` *(optional)*

- Analyzes the NetCDF files to determine the optimal grid resolution.
- Uses the trade-off between standard error and the number of bins with ≥30 measurements (lower limit of the central limit theorem).
- Suggested resolution: 225 km for WIC, 450 km for SI12 and SI13.

### `make_conductance_orbit_files.py`

- Ingests the NetCDF files and estimates ionospheric conductance **[1,2,4]**.

### `make_spline_model.py`

- *(Not implemented yet)*
